The Hextech Draw Simulator (HDS) is a tool for deckbuilding and theorycrafting, in which players can choose ranges of cards they would like to draw by certain turns, and the HDS will report the probability of that occuring. The addition of the HDS will allow ...continue to expand here


We propose that the HDS should be added to the current Legends of Runeterra deckbuilding page, as it is a low-cost, easy to implement functionality with immense potential given the supporting artwork and animation for the GUI.
